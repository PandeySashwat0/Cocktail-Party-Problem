# Solution Overview

To resolve the problem of individual source extraction and identification in noisy environments the following solution has been implemented. 
- Uniform Linear Array is used

  
- Wideband to narrowband conversion has been done using WAVES method. DOA algorithms work best with very narrowband signals

  
- DOA Estimation is performed using MUSIC Algorithm
